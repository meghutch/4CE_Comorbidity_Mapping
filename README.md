Specifically, these scripts modify the *icd* functions to map to the truncated ICD codes of the 4CE COVID-19 patients. 

The *icd* functions provide quick mapping to ICD 9 & 10 codes which have been validated as indicators of comorbidities and used in several comobridity scoring indexes including Charlson, Quan-Deyo, and Quan-Elixhauser.
